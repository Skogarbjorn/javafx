# Archive of JavaFX Projects

Here lie the old old projects that I did with JavaFX. Some of them are barebones tests, some though, are genuine projects that I am pretty proud of.

Notable projects include goodCAlc, bombermanTest, AudioPlayerRedo, and LodeRunner, which is a little bugged currently but you can check out [https://github.com/Elyo3/LodeRunner](here)
